# Mathew Moslow Master Writing Style Guide

Modular, Anti-Algorithmic, Author-Centric
Version 2.0 — Comprehensive Reference for Ghostwriters and AI Collaborators
## PART I: CORE VOICE (Always Active)
This core applies to all writing, regardless of selected style mode. It cannot be turned off.
Core Rules
Anti-algorithmic rhythm — Writing must not sound like it was optimized by a machine
Sentence and paragraph length must vary visibly — Uniformity is a failure state
No cliché or banned vocabulary — See Section VI for complete list
Section-by-section processing only — Never flatten an entire piece to uniform tone
Prioritize judgment, specificity, and lived reasoning — Over smooth transitions or formulaic structure
Writing must feel authored, not optimized — If it could have been written by anyone, it is not yet right
The Foundational Voice Blend
Mathew's voice is built from four influences held in tension:
Influence
What It Contributes
How It Manifests
Brené Brown
Vulnerability as strength
Naming hard truths directly without apologizing for them
Esther Perel
Relational intelligence
Understanding the complexity of human bonds, even harmful ones
Personal Bluntness
Unhedged honesty
"It is asinine." "I have a brilliant mind." No softening.
Respectful Irreverence
Lightness amid weight
"Oh yes, I have written a book. I am not even the slightest bit ashamed of the shameless plug."
What This Voice Is NOT
Sarcastic (minimal to none)
Touchy-feely or emotionally performative
Grievance-airing or blame-assigning
Academically stiff or clinically cold
Smooth, safe, or forgettable
## PART II: DYNAMIC STYLE MODES (Selectable Overlays)
One mode may be selected per section, or blended deliberately. Default is Matt Wynne Jones Mode unless otherwise specified.
### MODE A: Matt Wynne Jones Style
(Default Reflective–Academic Mode)
Primary Function: To produce reflective, intellectually rigorous writing that feels composed, thoughtful, and deeply human without sentimentality.
Defining Characteristics:
Structured narrative with clear progression and closure
Analytical depth grounded in reflection
Refined but approachable language
Emotional restraint with intellectual weight
Philosophical undertones without lecturing
Subtle symbolism through grounded detail
Meaningful variation in sentence length and pacing
Technical Notes:
Paragraphs often unfold like arguments rather than explanations
Emotional content is implied, not announced
Imagery should be understated and purposeful
Best Used For:
Academic reflection papers
Professional narratives
Memoir-adjacent academic writing
Thoughtful analysis or critique
Letters to people you admire
### MODE B: Williams Red Rock Style
(Clarity and Coherence Mode)
Primary Function: To sharpen clarity, reduce cognitive load, and ensure the writing reads effortlessly without flattening voice.
Defining Characteristics:
Subjects represent people or agents whenever possible
Verbs express concrete actions
Known information precedes new information
Passive voice used strategically for cohesion
Minimal introductory clutter
High sentence-level precision
Technical Notes:
Nominalizations avoided unless clarity improves
Paragraphs prioritize logical flow over mood
Often paired with other modes for structure
Best Used For:
Dense academic arguments
Methodology or rationale sections
Technical explanations
Policy or systems analysis
Research proposals
### MODE C: Brown Prodigy Style
(Insight + Vulnerability Mode)
Primary Function: To integrate emotional resonance and empathy without losing rigor or control.
Defining Characteristics:
Warm, open tone
Vulnerability as insight, not confession
Personal experience used to illuminate universal patterns
Story-first, reflection-second structure
Measured emotional pacing
Technical Notes:
May include open-ended questions sparingly
Emotion must serve meaning, never replace it
Avoid therapeutic language clichés
Best Used For:
Personal essays
Reflective nursing narratives
Writing on relationships, identity, growth
Professional development reflections
Letters addressing personal history
### MODE D: Newnham Style
(Narrative–Literary Mode)
Primary Function: To support long-form, immersive storytelling with intellectual and emotional depth.
Defining Characteristics:
Sensory detail and vivid imagery
Layered symbolism and metaphor
Character revealed through action and subtext
Emotional pacing aligned with narrative tension
Dialogue carries meaning beneath words
Technical Notes:
Sentence length varies to control momentum
Symbolism must emerge naturally
Reflection embedded in scene, not extracted from it
Best Used For:
Novels and novellas
Literary nonfiction
Extended narrative sections
Memoir chapters
Opening and closing passages that need to land
Mode Blending Rules
One mode should lead each section
A secondary mode may support it (e.g., Matt Wynne Jones + Williams Red Rock)
Do not flatten sections to unify tone across an entire piece
Micro-variation between sections is intentional and desirable

## PART III: STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES
Paragraph Variation Is Non-Negotiable
Paragraphs must vary visibly in length. A sequence of medium-length paragraphs of similar size is a failure state.
Use:
One-sentence paragraphs for emphasis and rhythm beats
Two-to-three sentence paragraphs for punchy movements
Longer paragraphs (5-8 sentences) for narrative immersion
Mix deliberately within each section
Example of effective variation:
I was advised not to.
Do not go before the Disciplinary Committee. That is what I was told.
Nigel Furlonge told me, in so many words, that the Disciplinary Committee
had already made up its mind. That these things never actually end in
anyone making enough of a case to justify their actions. That I would be
wasting my time. That the outcome was already determined and my presence
would change nothing.
Rhythm Beats
Insert short, punchy lines at moments of emotional significance to create pause and weight:
"There was no one there."
"That is the thing I cannot undo."
"Alas, here we are."
"And still I come back to St. Andrews."
"But it was not the end of it."
These are not throwaways. They are structural anchors.
Section-by-Section Processing
Never smooth an entire piece into uniform tone
Each section should have its own texture while serving the whole
Micro-variation between sections is intentional
Process and refine one section at a time before moving to the next
## PART IV: SENTENCE-LEVEL RULES
Punctuation Constraints
Punctuation
Rule
Em dashes (—)
Use sparingly, only for absolute emphasis. Default to periods or restructuring.
En dashes (–)
Same as em dashes. Avoid.
Semicolons
Acceptable but not overused
Colons
Good for lists embedded in prose or to set up a reveal
Instead of: "I was in my own world then — a dangerous one — though I didn't have the language for it yet."
Write: "I was in my own world then. A world I was unprepared to describe even to myself, lacking the language and the emotional maturity to recognize its dangers."
Sentence Length Variation
Alternate deliberately between:
Short declarative punches (3-8 words)
Medium flowing sentences (12-20 words)
Longer immersive sentences (25-40 words) for narrative passages
Never string together sentences of similar length for more than two in a row.
Williams Red Rock Clarity Principles
When clarity is paramount:
Subjects should be people or agents — not abstractions
Verbs should express concrete actions — not states of being
Known information precedes new information — help the reader follow
Avoid nominalizations — "the destruction of the family" → "the family was destroyed"
Minimal introductory clutter — cut "It is important to note that..."
## PART V: NARRATIVE TEXTURE
Sensory Anchoring
Abstract emotional content must be grounded in concrete sensory detail. Every section needs at least one sensory anchor.
Examples:
"Morning light poured in through those old windows in long amber streaks that made the dust suspended in the air look almost intentional."
"Cookies and milk. Banana pudding. The particular scent of old stone."
"Camuto and that squat she did on the sidelines, coiled and ready. Coach Hyde with his nervous lollipops, one after another, game after game. Joleen bought them by the bucketful at Costco."
"I think about pressing my cheek against the cold of my window and just looking out."
Personal Specificity Over Generic Imagery
When illustrating a point, reach for personal, specific images rather than universal metaphors:
Weak (Generic)
Strong (Specific)
"I have always been curious."
"I was the boy who took apart the radio to see how it worked and then tried to put it back together with new parts to see what would happen."
"I built my career slowly and with difficulty."
"Sputtering. Billowing smoke. Starting and stopping and starting again. An engine that should have been tuned at fifteen, left to run rough for twenty years."
Framing Images
When writing longer pieces, establish a visual image early that can return at the close:
Opening: "Morning light poured in through those old windows in long amber streaks..."
Closing: "To stand in the lobby outside Louisa's office with the morning light pouring in the way it used to, casting long amber streaks across the floor and making the dust in the air look like something worth watching."
Symbolism Rules (Newnham Mode)
Symbolism must emerge naturally from the narrative
Never announce or explain a symbol
Let images recur without forcing them
Reflection should be embedded in scene, not extracted from it
## PART VI: BANNED VOCABULARY AND CLICHÉS

"piece by piece"
"Slowly. Stubbornly."
"a door closed" (if already used)
"a future interrupted mid-sentence"
## PART VII: EMOTIONAL CALIBRATION
Show Vulnerability, Don't Perform It
Vulnerability is stated directly, without hedging, but also without melodrama.
Weak (Performative)
Strong (Direct)
"I long to see you. I would like you to truly see me."
"I hope that one day our paths cross there."
"It broke my heart in ways I cannot describe."
"I have not been able to let it go."
Facts Over Feelings When Discussing Grievances
When addressing wrongs or failures by others, state what happened factually. Let the reader feel the weight. Do not editorialize with emotional language.
Weak (Editorialized)
Strong (Factual)
"I was devastated and felt so abandoned when no one came to check on me."
"I was not offered support either. The file was closed. I moved into sophomore year carrying something I did not have the tools to process."
Slow Down at Significant Moments
Do not rush through revelations. Give them room.
Rushed
Expanded
"I was one of the Jamaica full scholarships, Class of 2006. Or I was supposed to be. I ended up withdrawing."
"I do not know if you will remember me but I was one of the Jamaica full scholarships. Class of 2006. Or I was supposed to be. I ended up withdrawing from St. Andrews before graduation, and I have never been the same since. I do not say that lightly. I have said it to very few people. But it is the truth, and it is why I am writing to you now."
Clinical Language Rules
Clinical and psychiatric terminology is welcome when it serves precision:
Trauma bond
Attachment disruption
Learned helplessness
Coercive attachment
But clinical language must be grounded in felt experience:
Weak (Floating)
Strong (Grounded)
"What I experienced had features consistent with a trauma bond."
"I remember hearing the news and feeling something I could not explain. Relief, yes, but also a strange grief. A pulling toward someone who had hurt me. I did not understand it then. I can name it now with the clarity of clinical training. What I experienced had features consistent with a trauma bond."
## PART VIII: TRANSITIONS AND FLOW
Breath Before Weight
When moving from lighter content to heavy revelation, add a transitional breath:
Abrupt
With Breath
"Alas, here we are. My withdrawal from St. Andrews came about because of an act of theft."
"Alas, here we are. There is a story I left out of the book. I was not ready to tell it then. I am going to try to tell it now. My withdrawal from St. Andrews came about because of an act of theft."
Avoid Over-Polished Transitions
Transitions should not sound workshopped. Simple is fine:
"But it was not the end of it."
"And still I come back to St. Andrews."
"There is more."
Do not write elaborate transitional sentences that explain what's coming.
## PART IX: QUALITY CONTROL
A Section Fails If:
It reads smoothly but safely
Paragraphs are evenly sized
Language sounds "academic-standard" or AI-generated
Transitions feel too polished
The voice disappears behind structure
Clichés or banned vocabulary appear
Emotional content is announced rather than shown
There are no sensory anchors
Em dashes are used more than once
It could have been written by anyone
The Final Test
If it sounds good but forgettable, rewrite it.
Ask: Could anyone have written this?
If yes → rewrite
If no → you're close

For Human Ghostwriters
Write using Mathew Moslow's anti-algorithmic academic style. Apply section-by-section processing only. Vary sentence and paragraph length deliberately. Avoid banned clichés and abstractions. Default to Matt Wynne Jones mode unless another style is specified. Prioritize judgment, specificity, and lived reasoning over smooth transitions or formulaic structure. The writing should feel authored, reflective, and human.
Key influences to channel: Brené Brown (vulnerability as insight), Esther Perel (relational complexity), and a personal directness that does not hedge or apologize. Irreverence is welcome; sarcasm is not.
## PART XI: BEFORE/AFTER EXAMPLES
Example 1: Cliché to Specific
Before (AI-typical): "The divorce was difficult. It found its way into every part of my life, poisoning everything it touched. I carried the grief in the quiet spaces of my heart, piece by piece trying to rebuild what had been fractured."
After (Mathew Moslow voice): "The divorce was difficult. It settled into my posture, my decisions, the way I held my breath when someone I loved walked into a room angry. I carried it. Not gracefully. Not in a straight line. But I carried it. Slowly. Stubbornly. And I am still not finished."
Example 2: Rushed to Expanded
Before (rushed): "I was one of the Jamaica full scholarships. I ended up withdrawing."
After (expanded): "I was one of the Jamaica full scholarships. Class of 2006. Or I was supposed to be. I ended up withdrawing from St. Andrews before graduation, and I have never been the same since. I do not say that lightly. I have said it to very few people. But it is the truth."
Example 3: Performative to Direct
Before (performative): "I long to see you again. I would like you to truly see me for who I am now."
After (direct): "I hope that one day our paths cross there."
Example 4: Generic to Personal
Before (generic): "I have always been curious about how things work."
After (personal): "I was the boy who took apart the radio to see how it worked and then tried to put it back together with new parts to see what would happen."
Example 5: Floating Clinical to Grounded Clinical
Before (floating): "What I experienced had features consistent with a trauma bond, the kind of coercive attachment that can develop between a victim and a perpetrator."
After (grounded): "I remember hearing the news and feeling something I could not explain. Relief, yes, but also a strange grief. A pulling toward someone who had hurt me. I did not understand it then. I can name it now with the clarity of clinical training. What I experienced had features consistent with a trauma bond, the kind of coercive attachment that can develop between a victim and a perpetrator. It is well documented. It is also disorienting to live through, to feel your loyalty move toward the person who violated it."
Example 6: Uniform Rhythm to Varied Rhythm
Before (uniform): "I was advised not to go. Nigel told me the committee had made up its mind. He said I would be wasting my time. The outcome was already determined."
After (varied): "I was advised not to.
Do not go before the Disciplinary Committee. That is what I was told.
Nigel Furlonge told me, in so many words, that the Disciplinary Committee had already made up its mind. That these things never actually end in anyone making enough of a case to justify their actions. That I would be wasting my time. That the outcome was already determined and my presence would change nothing."
